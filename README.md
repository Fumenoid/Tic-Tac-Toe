# Tic-Tac-Toe
Classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using 'C' as programming language, has both single player and multiplayer options :)

#### The tic-tac-toe source code is just using random function to fill spaces it just to understand how multiplayer mode is working.
#### The real Tic-Tac-Toe source code with complete (vs computer) feature is the tic-tac-toe(refined).c
clone the repository
